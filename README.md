# ChirpUp

## How it works
Chirp-Up is a chatroom dedicated to the public discourse of contentious topics. For each discussion question, users select their stances and present a brief statement of their opinions. Then, they will be presented with a list of users online with opposing stances, from which they can choose people to chat with based on their statements. When both sides accept the invitation, they can start chatting!
